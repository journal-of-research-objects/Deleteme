	abstract = {The quality of RDF based solutions requires the possibility to describe and validate RDF graphs. In the recent years, two technologies have been proposed for RDF validation: ShEx and SHACL. RDFShape is a web service that can be used as an RDF playground to validate RDF with those technologies, but can also be used as a general RDF playground allowing to parse, convert, visualize and query RDF data. The validation engine supports both ShEx and SHACL, allows the conversion between diﬀerent schema formats, and is able visualize schemas using UML-like class diagrams. The system oﬀers the possibility to play with diﬀerent RDF technologies in a uniﬁed setting and has already been used to teach RDF technologies in several courses and tutorials. It has also been employed in industrial RDF workﬂows that needed a web service for RDF data validation and management.},

However, to realize its full potential to support these goals, several problems, such as fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability and different conceptualization of the data must be overcome. To provide the community with a resource free of these hurdles, we have developed DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org), one of the largest available collections of genes and variants involved in human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype–phenotype relationships. The information is accessible through a web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL endpoint, scripts in several programming languages and an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform that can be used for different research purposes including the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of specific human diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypothesis on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.},

We expose our models, services, software and datasets. Our infrastructure enables manual and semi-automatic annotation, resulting data are represented as RDF-based linked data and can be readily queried using the SPARQL query language. We illustrate the utility of our system with several use cases. Our datasets, methods and techniques are available at http://biotea.github.io.},

We describe the FAIR Evaluator, a software infrastructure to register and execute tests of compliance with the recently published FAIR Metrics. The Evaluator enables digital resources to be assessed objectively and transparently. We illustrate its application to three widely used generalist repositories - Dataverse, Dryad, and Zenodo - and report their feedback. Evaluations allow communities to select relevant Metric subsets to deliver FAIRness measurements in diverse and specialized applications. Evaluations are executed in a semi-automated manner through Web Forms filled-in by a user, or through a JSON-based API. A comparison of manual vs automated evaluation reveals that automated evaluations are generally stricter, resulting in lower, though more accurate, FAIRness scores. Finally, we highlight the need for enhanced infrastructure such as standards registries, like FAIRsharing, as well as additional community involvement in domain-specific data infrastructure creation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract="The RDF data model forms a cornerstone of the Semantic Web technology stack. Although there have been different proposals for RDF serialization syntaxes, the underlying simple data model enables great flexibility which allows it to be successfully employed in many different scenarios and to form the basis on which other technologies are developed. In order to apply an RDF-based approach in practice it is necessary to communicate the structure of the data that is being stored or represented. Data quality is of paramount importance for the acceptance of RDF as a data representation language and it must be enabled by the use of tools that can check if some data conforms to some specific structure. There have been several recent proposals for RDF validation languages like ShEx and SHACL. In this chapter, we describe both proposals and enumerate some challenges and trends that we foresee with regards to RDF validation. We devote more space to what we consider one of the main challenges, which is to compare ShEx and SHACL and to understand their underlying foundations. To that end, we propose an intermediate language and show how ShEx and SHACL can be converted to it.",
